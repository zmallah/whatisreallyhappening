What is Really Happening
------------------------
*"What is really Happening"* is a fun program, which takes uploaded pictures and turns them into fun little conversations. It uses amazon rekognition, an AWS photo analysis and facial recognition API, to understand what is going on in the picture and turn it into a random funny story for everyone.
